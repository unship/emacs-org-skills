;; Functions for reading and editing sections within notes.
;; A "section" is the body text owned by a single org node — the content
;; between a heading's metadata and the next heading.  For file-level
;; nodes (level 0), the section is the preamble before the first heading.
;; All public functions accept node IDs only (no title fallback).
